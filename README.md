# Customer Banking System

## Overview
This project simulates a simple banking system using Python classes and object-oriented programming principles. It was completed as part of an early programming assignment to demonstrate the use of inheritance, method overriding, and modular design.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Git
- GitHub

## Project Contents
- `Account.py`: Base class defining core account attributes and behaviors.
- `cd_account.py`: Subclass implementing behavior for Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts.
- `savings_account.py`: Subclass implementing behavior for savings accounts.
- `customer_banking.py`: Main script to interact with different account types and simulate basic banking operations.

## Features
- Object-oriented structure using inheritance and modular design.
- Simulates deposits, withdrawals, balance inquiries, and account-specific rules.
- Example implementation of class constructors, method overriding, and simple user interaction flow.
- Organized into logical files for better maintainability.

## Getting Started
Clone the repository and run the banking simulation script:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lordegraves/customer_banking.git
cd customer_banking
python customer_banking.py
